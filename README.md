## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a DevOps Engineer working in Virginia, United States.

I like to work on Terraform and Kubernetes, as well as building scripts and tools in Bash and Python.

I love using Obsidian, you may see that my hours in Markdown are high. In addition to building resources in Obsidian, I also work on them for my codebases.

I plan to include more public content on my GitHub for reference. I would like to contribute more to the FOSS landscape.
